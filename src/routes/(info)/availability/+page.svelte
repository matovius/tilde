<div class="w-full">
	<h1 class="text-center">Tilde's Availability</h1>

	<p>
		As mentioned on the landing page, Tilde is currently only available as a demo. This doesn't mean
		it has no functionality. All visible elements are functional.
	</p>
	<p>
		What this means is that anything you write in the editor is not saved on a server. It is
		however, saved to your browser's <code>localStorage</code>.
	</p>
	<p>
		There will eventually be a way for you to share what you write via a temporary URL that's only
		available for 24-hours until renewed by visiting that URL within 23 hours after creation.
