	Tilde is only available as a demo. Anything and everything you write in the editor stays in the
	editor stays in your browser. You can download this content if you need it. There's currently two
	download options: HTML and JSON. Markdown is currently in the works and will probably be avaliable
	some time soon.

	All your data will be erased once you close the browser tab or window unless you download it. Your
	data will at some point be saved in <code>localStorage</code> to help you not lose any of your data
	in case something weird happens.
